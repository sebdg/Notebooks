    Page: Artificial intelligence art
    Summary: Artificial intelligence art is any visual artwork created through the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) program.   
    Artists began to utilize artificial intelligence in the mid to late 20th century, when the discipline was founded. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many  philosophical concerns related to the human mind, artificial beings, and what can be considered art in a human–AI collaboration. Since the 20th century, AI art has been exhibited in prominent museums and has won prestigious awards.   
    The increased availability of AI art tools to the general public in the 2020s AI boom provided opportunities for creating AI outside of academia and professional artists. Commentary about AI art in the 2020s has often focused on issues related to copyright, deception, defamation, and its impact on more traditional artists, including technological unemployment.  

    Page: Artificial general intelligence
    Summary: Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform as well or better than humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks. This is in contrast to narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks. AGI is considered one of various definitions of strong AI.
    Creating AGI is a primary goal of AI research and of companies such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic. A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI R&D projects spread across 37 countries.
    The timeline for achieving AGI remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts. As of 2023, some argue that it may be possible in years or decades; others maintain it might take a century or longer; and a minority believe it may never be achieved. There is debate on the exact definition of AGI, and regarding whether modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are early, incomplete forms of AGI. AGI is a common topic in science fiction and futures studies.
    Contention exists over the potential for AGI to pose a threat to humanity; for example, OpenAI claims to treat it as an existential risk, while others find the development of AGI to be too remote to present a risk.

    Page: Applications of artificial intelligence
    Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in applications throughout industry and academia. Similar to electricity or computers, AI serves as a general-purpose technology that has numerous applications. Its applications span language translation, image recognition, decision-making, credit scoring, e-commerce and various other domains. AI which accommodates such technologies as machines being equipped perceive, understand, act and learning a scientific discipline.

    Authors: Chengpeng Hu, Yunlong Zhao, Ziqi Wang, Haocheng Du, Jialin Liu
    Summary: Games have been the perfect test-beds for artificial intelligence research
    for the characteristics that widely exist in real-world scenarios. Learning and
    optimisation, decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments, game
    theory, planning and scheduling, design and education are common research areas
    shared between games and real-world problems. Numerous open-source games or
    game-based environments have been implemented for studying artificial
    intelligence. In addition to single- or multi-player, collaborative or
    adversarial games, there has also been growing interest in implementing
    platforms for creative design in recent years. Those platforms provide ideal
    benchmarks for exploring and comparing artificial intelligence ideas and
    techniques. This paper reviews the game-based platforms for artificial
    intelligence research, provides guidance on matching particular types of
    artificial intelligence with suitable games for testing and matching particular
    needs in games with suitable artificial intelligence techniques, discusses the

    Title: Conceptual Modeling and Artificial Intelligence: A Systematic Mapping Study
    Authors: Dominik Bork, Syed Juned Ali, Ben Roelens
    Summary: In conceptual modeling (CM), humans apply abstraction to represent excerpts
    of reality for means of understanding and communication, and processing by
    machines. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is applied to vast amounts of data to
    automatically identify patterns or classify entities. While CM produces
    comprehensible and explicit knowledge representations, the outcome of AI
    algorithms often lacks these qualities while being able to extract knowledge
    from large and unstructured representations. Recently, a trend toward
    intertwining CM and AI emerged. This systematic mapping study shows how this
    interdisciplinary research field is structured, which mutual benefits are
    gained by the intertwining, and future research directions.

However, traditional im2col cannot efficiently support AI backpropagation. Backpropagation in convolutional layers involves performing transposed convolution and dilated convolution, which usually introduces plenty of zero-spaces into the feature map or kernel. The zero-space data reorganization interfere with the continuity of training and incur additional and non-negligible overhead in terms of off- and on-chip storage, access and performance. Since countermeasures for backpropagation are rarely proposed, we propose BP-im2col, a novel im2col algorithm for AI backpropagation, and implement it in RTL on a TPU-like accelerator. Experiments on TPU-like accelerator indicate that BP-im2col reduces the backpropagation runtime by 34.9% on average, and reduces the bandwidth of off-chip memory and on-chip buffers by at least 22.7% and 70.6% respectively, over a baseline accelerator adopting the traditional im2col. It further reduces the additional storage overhead in the backpropagation process by at least 74.78%.

    Published: 2018-07-21 Title: Decoupled Parallel Backpropagation with Convergence Guarantee Authors: Zhouyuan Huo, Bin Gu, Qian Yang, Heng Huang Summary: Backpropagation algorithm is indispensable for the training of feedforward neural networks. It requires propagating error gradients sequentially from the output layer all the way back to the input layer. The backward locking in backpropagation algorithm constrains us from updating network layers in parallel and fully leveraging the computing resources. Recently, several algorithms have been proposed for breaking the backward locking. However, their performances degrade seriously when networks are deep. In this paper, we propose decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm for deep learning optimization with convergence guarantee. Firstly, we decouple the backpropagation algorithm using delayed gradients, and show that the backward locking is removed when we split the networks into multiple modules. Then, we utilize decoupled parallel backpropagation in two stochastic methods and prove that our method guarantees convergence to critical points for the non-convex problem. Finally, we perform experiments for training deep convolutional neural networks on benchmark datasets. The experimental results not only confirm our theoretical analysis, but also demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significant speedup without loss of accuracy.

    Published: 2024-05-14 Title: One Backpropagation in Two Tower Recommendation Models Authors: Erjia Chen, Bang Wang Summary: Recent years have witnessed extensive researches on developing two tower recommendation models for relieving information overload. Four building modules can be identified in such models, namely, user-item encoding, negative sampling, loss computing and back-propagation updating. To the best of our knowledge, existing algorithms have researched only on the first three modules, yet neglecting the backpropagation module. They all adopt a kind of two backpropagation strategy, which are based on an implicit assumption of equally treating users and items in the training phase. In this paper, we challenge such an equal training assumption and propose a novel one backpropagation updating strategy, which keeps the normal gradient backpropagation for the item encoding tower, but cuts off the backpropagation for the user encoding tower. Instead, we propose a moving-aggregation updating strategy to update a user encoding in each training epoch. Except the proposed backpropagation updating module, we implement the other three modules with the most straightforward choi

    Page: Artificial intelligence Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs. AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore." Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, and after 2017 with the transformer architecture. This led to the AI boom of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence. The growing use of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is influencing a societal and economic shift towards increased automation, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of AI systems into various economic sectors and areas of life, impacting job markets, healthcare, government, industry, and education. This raises questions about the long-term effects, ethical implications, and risks of AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. The various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.

    Page: Generative artificial intelligence Summary: Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI, GenAI, or GAI) is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models, often in response to prompts. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics. Improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), enabled an AI boom of generative AI systems in the early 2020s. These include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and LLaMA, text-to-image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and DALL-E, and text-to-video AI generators such as Sora. Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative AI systems. Generative AI applications have been used for search engine optimization, customer service, automatic content creation, creative work, and many other tasks.

    Page: Machine learning Summary: Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance. ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. When applied to business problems, it is known under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods. The mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning. From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.

    Page: Quantum machine learning Summary: Quantum machine learning is the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning programs. The most common use of the term refers to machine learning algorithms for the analysis of classical data executed on a quantum computer, i.e. quantum-enhanced machine learning. While machine learning algorithms are used to compute immense quantities of data, quantum machine learning utilizes qubits and quantum operations or specialized quantum systems to improve computational speed and data storage done by algorithms in a program. This includes hybrid methods that involve both classical and quantum processing, where computationally difficult subroutines are outsourced to a quantum device. These routines can be more complex in nature and executed faster on a quantum computer. Furthermore, quantum algorithms can be used to analyze quantum states instead of classical data. Beyond quantum computing, the term "quantum machine learning" is also associated with classical machine learning methods applied to data generated from quantum experiments (i.e. machine learning of quantum systems), such as learning the phase transitions of a quantum system or creating new quantum experiments. Quantum machine learning also extends to a branch of research that explores methodological and structural similarities between certain physical systems and learning systems, in particular neural networks. For example, some mathematical and numerical techniques from quantum physics are applicable to classical deep learning and vice versa. Furthermore, researchers investigate more abstract notions of learning theory with respect to quantum information, sometimes referred to as "quantum learning theory".

    Page: Neural network (machine learning) Summary: In machine learning, a neural network (also artificial neural network or neural net, abbreviated ANN or NN) is a model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in animal brains. An ANN consists of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a brain. These are connected by edges, which model the synapses in a brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons. The "signal" is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs, called the activation function. The strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a weight, which adjusts during the learning process. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly passing through multiple intermediate layers (hidden layers). A netwo

    Page: Backpropagation Summary: In machine learning, backpropagation is a gradient estimation method used to train neural network models. The gradient estimate is used by the optimization algorithm to compute the network parameter updates. It is an efficient application of the Leibniz chain rule (1673) to such networks. It is also known as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation or reverse accumulation, due to Seppo Linnainmaa (1970). The term "back-propagating error correction" was introduced in 1962 by Frank Rosenblatt, but he did not know how to implement this, even though Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation already in 1960 in the context of control theory. Backpropagation computes the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input–output example, and does so efficiently, computing the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule; this can be derived through dynamic programming. Gradient descent, or variants such as stochastic gradient descent, are commonly used. Strictly the term backpropagation refers only to the algorithm for computing the gradient, not how the gradient is used; but the term is often used loosely to refer to the entire learning algorithm – including how the gradient is used, such as by stochastic gradient descent. In 1986 David E. Rumelhart et al. published an experimental analysis of the technique. This contributed to the popularization of backpropagation and helped to initiate an active period of research in multilayer perceptrons.

    Page: Backpropagation through time Summary: Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is a gradient-based technique for training certain types of recurrent neural networks. It can be used to train Elman networks. The algorithm was independently derived by numerous researchers.

    Page: Geoffrey Hinton Summary: Geoffrey Everest Hinton (born 6 December 1947) is a British-Canadian computer scientist and cognitive psychologist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks. From 2013 to 2023, he divided his time working for Google (Google Brain) and the University of Toronto, before publicly announcing his departure from Google in May 2023, citing concerns about the risks of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In 2017, he co-founded and became the chief scientific advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto. With David Rumelhart and Ronald J. Williams, Hinton was co-author of a highly cited paper published in 1986 that popularized the backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks, although they were not the first to propose the approach. Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community. The dramatic image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge 2012 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision. Hinton received the 2018 Turing Award, often referred to as the "Nobel Prize of Computing", together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning. They are sometimes referred to as the "Godfathers of Deep Learning", and have continued to give public talks together. In May 2023, Hinton announced his resignation from Google to be able to "freely speak out about the risks of A.I." He has voiced concerns about deliberate misuse by malicious actors, technological unemployment, and existential risk from artificial general intelligence.

Page: Backpropagation Summary: In machine learning, backpropagation is a gradient estimation method used to train neural network models. The gradient estimate is used by the optimization algorithm to compute the network parameter updates. It is an efficient application of the Leibniz chain rule (1673) to such networks. It is also known as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation or reverse accumulation, due to Seppo Linnainmaa (1970). The term "back-propagating error correction" was introduced in 1962 by Frank Rosenblatt, but he did not know how to implement this, even though Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation already in 1960 in the context of control theory. Backpropagation computes the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input–output example, and does so efficiently, computing the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule; this can be derived through dynamic programming. Gradient descent, or variants such as stochastic gradient descent, are commonly used. Strictly the term backpropagation refers only to the algorithm for computing the gradient, not how the gradient is used; but the term is often used loosely to refer to the entire learning algorithm – including how the gradient is used, such as by stochastic gradient descent. In 1986 David E. Rumelhart et al. published an experimental analysis of the technique. This contributed to the popularization of backpropagation and helped to initiate an active period of research in multilayer perceptrons.

Page: Backpropagation through time Summary: Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is a gradient-based technique for training certain types of recurrent neural networks. It can be used to train Elman networks. The algorithm was independently derived by numerous researchers.

Page: Neural backpropagation Summary: Neural backpropagation is the phenomenon in which, after the action potential of a neuron creates a voltage spike down the axon (normal propagation), another impulse is generated from the soma and propagates towards the apical portions of the dendritic arbor or dendrites (from which much of the original input current originated). In addition to active backpropagation of the action potential, there is also passive electrotonic spread. While there is ample evidence to prove the existence of backpropagating action potentials, the function of such action potentials and the extent to which they invade the most distal dendrites remain highly controversial.
